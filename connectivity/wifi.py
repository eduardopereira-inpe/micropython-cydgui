"""
Wi-Fi connectivity helpers for MicroPython ESP32.

This module intentionally creates the WLAN singleton during application
startup (boot time) instead of creating a new network.WLAN() instance
whenever a connection is requested.

Background:
On memory-constrained ESP32 devices running graphical interfaces
(for example CYD/Cheap Yellow Display applications using cydgui,
framebuffers, asyncio, and virtual keyboards), heap fragmentation
may occur during normal execution.

```
Even when gc.mem_free() reports sufficient free memory, the ESP32
Wi-Fi driver may require large contiguous memory blocks during
WLAN object creation. If the heap is fragmented, creating a new
network.WLAN(network.STA_IF) instance can fail with:

    RuntimeError: Wifi Unknown Error 0x0101

Initializing the WLAN instance during boot ensures that the Wi-Fi
driver allocates its internal resources before the heap becomes
fragmented, significantly improving reliability.
```

Implementation:
- Create the WLAN singleton once during startup.
- Reuse the same instance throughout the application lifecycle.
- Enable or disable the interface as needed.
- Never recreate the WLAN object during runtime.

Example:
WLAN = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
WLAN.active(False)

```
# Later...
WLAN.active(True)
WLAN.connect(ssid, password)
```
